        <h1>About Shaheed Bhagat Singh - A True Hero Of India</h1>
        <p class="text">
            Shaheed Bhagat Singh (1907–1931) was one of India’s greatest freedom fighters, remembered for his unmatched
            courage and sacrifice. Born in Punjab, he grew up with a deep love for the nation and dedicated his life to
            ending British rule.

            He became a revolutionary leader in the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA) and believed that
            true independence required bravery and sacrifice. From avenging Lala Lajpat Rai’s death to throwing bombs in
            the Central Assembly to “make the deaf hear,” Bhagat Singh fearlessly fought against injustice.

            On 23 March 1931, at just 23 years of age, Bhagat Singh, Rajguru, and Sukhdev were executed by the British.
            His sacrifice inspired millions, and his slogan “Inquilab Zindabad” still echoes in every Indian heart.
